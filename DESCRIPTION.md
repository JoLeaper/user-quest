This lab will be a Pokemon Adventure!

Your goal as a trainer will be to reach the Pokemon League!

To do so, you will need to travel across Kanto and battle a gym in each town to get their respective badge.

When you arrive to a town, you will have three types of Pokemon that you will be able to catch! If you pick the most effective one,
you will keep your health, but picking the least effective one will net you more exp!
